# Revenue Insights for Hospitality Domain - AtliQ Grands

## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been a prominent player in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making, they have been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. To regain their market share and revenue, the managing director of AtliQ Grands decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence. As they do not have an in-house data analytics team, they have hired a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands is experiencing declining revenue and market share in the luxury/business hotels category. The objective of this project is to provide insights using historical data to help AtliQ Grands regain their market share and optimize revenue generation.

## Project Objectives
1. Create relevant metrics according to the metric list provided by stakeholders.
2. Design and build a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Generate additional insights that are not part of the initial metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** for Data Transformation, Visualization, and Dashboard Creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for Creating Measures.

## Data Preparation Process
1. **Data Source Connection**: Imported the relevant data files into Power BI.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query Editor.
3. **DAX Measures Creation**: Created necessary measures to calculate KPIs.
4. **Dashboarding**: Designed a user-friendly dashboard to display insights effectively.

## Key Metrics Created
- **Revenue**
- **Occupancy %**
- **Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)**
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**
- **Daily Sellable Room Nights**
- **Realization %**

## Dashboard Features

## Insights Generated
1. **Pricing Strategy Needs Improvement**:
   - The trend analysis shows that the Average Daily Rate (ADR) is flat across different periods.
   - Lack of dynamic pricing strategy for weekends, weekdays, or holiday seasons.
   - Implementing dynamic pricing strategies could enhance revenue generation.

2. **Relationship Between Ratings and Occupancy**:
   - Hotels with lower average ratings tend to have lower occupancy rates.
   - Properties with higher ratings show higher occupancy rates.
   - Improving ratings through better services and facilities could improve occupancy.

## Recommendations
- Implement a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize revenue during peak and off-peak periods.
- Focus on enhancing customer experience to improve hotel ratings and boost occupancy rates.
